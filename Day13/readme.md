## 📚 Program List

### 1️⃣ Ternary Operator – Voting Eligibility
🔹 Demonstrates conditional evaluation using the ternary (`?:`) operator based on user-input age.

### 2️⃣ Switch Case – Day of the Week
🔹 Determines the day of the week by taking a number between 1 and 7 and mapping it to the correct day using `switch-case`.

### 3️⃣ Life Path Number (Numerology)
🔹 Calculates a life path number based on birth date input and displays a personalized message.

### 4️⃣ Fibonacci Sequence Generator
🔹 Outputs a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms using iterative logic.

### 5️⃣ Factorial Calculator
🔹 Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer using a `for` loop.

### 6️⃣ Countdown with While Loop
🔹 Prints a countdown from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop.

### 7️⃣ String Concatenation
🔹 Takes two strings as input from the user and outputs the concatenated result.

### 8️⃣ Binary to Decimal Converter
🔹 Converts a binary number (entered as an integer) into its decimal equivalent.

### 9️⃣ Array Min-Max Finder
🔹 Accepts an array of integers from the user and identifies the maximum and minimum values.

### 🔟 Pascal’s Triangle Generator
🔹 Prints Pascal’s Triangle based on a user-defined number of rows using combinatorial logic.

### 🔁 Voting Eligibility (If-Else Version)
🔹 Validates input and checks if a user is eligible to vote using `if-else` statements.
